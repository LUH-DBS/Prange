% \section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}
In this thesis I present a method to increase the efficiency of finding unique columns in a table. The method is based on a machine learning model which uses the first few rows to guess if each column will have any duplicate values. Each positive guess will subsequently be validated using a conventional naive method.

The proposed method works in three steps. First, the features are extracted from the first rows of the table. After that, the model tries to predict the existence of duplicate values from the features. Finally, the columns which are unique according to the model are checked with a naive method.

\section{Extracted Features}\label{sec:extracted_features} % TODO: Writing
The feature extraction is necessary as explained in Section~\ref{sec:machine_learning}

It differentiates between 4 cases

An example of a table with the extracted features is the Table~\ref{table:feature_table_example}.

\section{Training the Model}\label{sec:traing_the_model} % TODO: Writing
How was the model trained? What settings where used for the training and why?
