\section{Naive Algorithms for finding primary key candidates}
There are two basic ways of finding primary key candidates. Both of them are traversing each column and comparing its values to detect duplicates.

The first method works by traversing a column, forming the hash value of each row and saving this hash value in a suitable data structure. If the hash value of a row is already present, the algorithm aborts because it is clear that the column is not unique.

The other method operates by sorting the column in a first step and then comparing each row with its neighbors. If two rows are the same, the column is not unique.
