\section{Machine Learning}\label{sec:machine_learning}
Machine learning is a part of the field of Artificial Intelligence. The focus is on extracting information from large amounts of data, with algorithms gradually improving themselves to mimic human learning~\cite{what-is-ml}.

The field of machine learning is itself divided into two main branches, Classical learning and Deep learning~\cite{ml-visual-explanation}.

\subsection{Deep Learning and Neural Networks}

Deep Learning includes various techniques that make use of neural networks. In the simplest form, neural networks consist of different so-called nodes, which are arranged as layers~\cite{neuralNet}.

The first layer, also known as the input layer, is the layer the input vector is applied to. If the input exceeds a certain value, the neuron is activated, meaning that it passes on an output.

In the next layers, which are called hidden layers, the outputs from all nodes from the previous layer and the bias are computed in each node after which the output is passed on to the next layer. The bias node consists of a single value that influences all nodes on a layer.

Finally, the last layer outputs the result of the computation. How strong each previous node influences the value of the current node is what the neural network is trained on.

Neural networks are particularly good at recognizing patterns in large unordered data, such as images, videos, and audio tracks. Examples of this include facial recognition or verifying hand signatures~\cite{neuralNet-applications}.

\subsection{Classical Learning}

Algorithms in the field of classical machine learning are largely based on statistical or probabilistic methods, which originated as pattern recognition in the 1960s. It has the advantage of being a fast method that does not require much computing power and does not need as much training data compared to deep learning algorithms~\cite{classical-ml}.

Another benefit in using classical learning is that it is easier to understand how the machine learning algorithm made its decision, since it is calculated from statistical dependencies between the data points. This comes with the drawback that a classical learning model is not capable of learning general concepts and applying them to completely new data~\cite{what-is-ml}.

\subsection{Categories of Machine Learning}
There are different types of machine learning depending on the task and training data the machine learning model has to work with.

Unsupervised learning is used on unlabeled data. Its main use is to organize the data or to make it more manageable. Tasks in this domain include clustering, which categorizes data based on similar data points, or association, which tries to find relationships between variables in a dataset~\cite{supervised-unsupervised-learning}.

Supervised learning on the other hand makes use of labeled data which consists of several features that were selected in advance. This comes with the disadvantage that the structure of the data as well as the desired results have to be known~\cite{classical-ml}. Even though it increases the effort of the preparation of the training data, it also raises the accuracy of the model since it is trained to produce exactly the desired result.

With reinforcement learning, the machine learning model is trained by interacting with its environment through the context of states. The model learns which action it has to perform to reach its goal for each given state~\cite{types-of-ml}.
