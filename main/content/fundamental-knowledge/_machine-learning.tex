\section{Machine Learning}\label{sec:machine_learning}
Machine learning is a part of the field of \ac{ai}. The focus is on extracting information from large amounts of data, with algorithms gradually improving themselves to mimic human learning~\cite{what-is-ml}.

Machine learning algorithms generally require labeled data to extract information. This labelled data consists mostly of a table where each column corresponds to a feature, which is a specific aspect the algorithm can use to infer some information. % Is a citation necessary?

TODO\@: Deep Learning, unlabeled data (images etc)
