\section{Definition of terms used}\label{sec:definition_terms}
Primary key candidates are columns in a table which do not have any duplicate values and are therefore suited to identify a row in the table. In this thesis, a column that contains only distinct values, one of which is a None/Null value, is considered non-unique as it can not be used as a primary key.
