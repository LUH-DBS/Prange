\chapter{Problem Statement}\label{chap:problem_statement} %! TODO: writing
Primary key candidates are columns which do not have any duplicate values and can therefore be used to identify a row in the table.

Even though the discovery of unique column combinations is a topic which receives a lot of attention because of its applications in the fields of data discovery and data analysis, the underlying algorithm to determine whether a column is unique is unchanged.

For the purposes of this thesis, a column that contains a None/Null value is considered non-unique as it can not be used as a primary key.

The runtime of a conventional naive algorithm is in \(O(n)\) or \(O(\log(n))\) as explained in Section~\ref{sec:naive_algorithm}. This becomes a problem when the tables have several million rows.
