\section{Possible Applications}
Usage as part of a larger algorithm or programm to speed up the process of finding unique columns. This way it is possible to ensure to only use the table if it is large enough for the proposed method to be advantageous.

Maybe an advantage that the method produces possible uniques very fast and verifies them afterwards.

Perhaps the principle of narrowing the columns of the table to inspect closely with a machine learning model can be transferred to other aspects than finding unique columns.


\section{Limitations of the method}
The method only searches for single column uniques. Maybe it is possible to combine it with an existing algorithm for finding multi column uniques and speeding it up.

There is a possibilty that a unique column is classified as a non-unique by the proposed method. To rule out this possibilty, all the columns would have to be inspected with the naive algorithm.
