\section{Correctness}
\begin{itemize}
  \item measure accuracy and precision of the method
        \begin{itemize}
          \item with 5, 10 and 20 rows as input (do more rows make a difference with large tables?)
          \item overall and only non trivial
          \item trained on one dataset and used on another
          \item trained on multiple datasets
        \end{itemize}
  \item explore the weaknesses of the method
        \begin{itemize}
          \item what does a column look like which causes problems
        \end{itemize}
