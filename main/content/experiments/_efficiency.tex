\section{Efficiency}
\begin{itemize}
  \item compare the speed to the naive algorithm
        \begin{itemize}
          \item with 5, 10 and 20 rows as input
          \item measure the time with locally saved tables and tables from the database
        \end{itemize}
  \item is a higher efficiency possible by reading only as many rows/columns as necessary?
\end{itemize}
