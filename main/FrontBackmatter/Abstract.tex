\chapter*{Abstract}
The discovery of primary key candidates and unique columns in general is an important problem. While primary keys are required to efficiently interact with data stored in a table, various information can be obtained from the uniqueness of a column. % TODO: write better
The current algorithms to find unique columns work in a linear runtime and are therefore not fast enough for large tables.

In this thesis, I propose a new method to detect unique columns. It uses a machine learning model to predict which columns are probably unique. Only positive guesses will be checked for duplicates using a conventional algorithm. With this method, the time it takes to detect all unique columns is reduced by more than \SI{65}{\percent} for large tables with more than \num{10000000} rows. % 10.000.000 rows, parquet: model is 3,15 times faster than naive

%? Ideas: something about supervised learning, column preparation, maybe github link?
